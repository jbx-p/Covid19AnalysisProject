### Overview

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is an infectious ailment characterized by a range of respiratory symptoms. While many individuals experience mild to moderate manifestations and recuperate without specialized care, some may develop severe complications requiring medical intervention. Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those with pre-existing health conditions like cardiovascular ailments or diabetes, face an increased risk of severe illness. However, COVID-19 can affect individuals of any age, potentially leading to serious outcomes.

To mitigate transmission, it is essential to stay informed about the disease's characteristics and transmission mechanisms. Measures such as maintaining physical distance, wearing masks correctly, and practicing regular hand hygiene significantly reduce the risk of infection. Vaccination, following local health guidelines, and adhering to respiratory etiquette—such as covering coughs and sneezes—also play crucial roles in preventing the spread of the virus.

COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets or aerosols emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings, or breathes. Adhering to respiratory hygiene practices and promptly isolating oneself if feeling unwell are essential precautions to limit transmission.
